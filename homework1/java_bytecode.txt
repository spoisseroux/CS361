ILOAD seems to load an int from a variable
IINC seems to increment a variable
GOTO seems to make the code jump to a specified location

Assignments seems to be done with ILOAD / ICONST_X followed by a ISTORE,
with increment assignment being handled by IINC
Loops seem to be handled using the layout of the LX 'chunks' of bytecode and 
using the GOTO to execute them in the correct order while also using IF_ICMPLE
to check comparisons for the loops statements and IRETURN to return
